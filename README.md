# **Black Box Network: Proof of Concept**
# I Jonas Kasper Jensen can not code and have been working with AI to create this Proof of concept. If the project is founded I will work with an profesional programmer to create code

The Black Box Network is a decentralized AI-powered system that integrates artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and the concept of Artificially Induced Timestretching (AIT). This project explores secure, personalized AI collaboration, synthetic immune systems, and data sharing in a decentralized framework, pushing the boundaries of human interaction and creativity.

## **Project Overview**
The Black Box Network envisions a secure system where users interact with personal AI agents housed in isolated environments. These agents evolve through collaboration with their users and with other Black Boxes, forming a synthetic immune system—a decentralized and adaptive network designed to address challenges and foster collective intelligence. The system leverages Avalanche blockchain for identity and data security through soulbound tokens (SBTs) and NFTs.

Artificially Induced Timestretching (AIT) extends the experience of time in virtual environments, enabling users to achieve immersive, timeless interactions and shared experiences.

## **Directory Structure**
The project is divided into components for clarity and ease of development:
```

├── ai_blackbox.py         # Code for the AI-powered Black Box
├── blockchain_integration.py  # Code for Avalanche blockchain integration
├── soulbound_token.sol    # Solidity smart contract for the SBT
├── synthetic_immunesystem.py  # Code for the Synthetic Immune System simulation
├── content_manager.py     # Code for secure content uploading
├── box_interaction.py     # Code for Black Box meetings and data exchange
├── main_integration.py    # Complete integration of all components
├── README.md              # Documentation for the project
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
└── LICENSE                # License for the repository (e.g., GNU GPL)
```

## **Key Features**
- **AI Collaboration:** Each Black Box contains an evolving AI agent that interacts with its user and collaborates with others.
- **Blockchain Security:** Soulbound tokens (SBTs) secure user identities, while NFTs protect shared creations.
- **Synthetic Immune System:** A decentralized framework emerges from interconnected Black Boxes.
- **Artificially Induced Timestretching (AIT):** Extends subjective time for immersive experiences.
- **Data Isolation and Sharing:** Black Boxes securely store and share data during collaborative exchanges.

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `transformers` library for AI simulations (`pip install transformers`)
- `web3` library for blockchain integration (`pip install web3`)
- Solidity compiler for deploying smart contracts (e.g., Remix IDE or Hardhat)

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackbox-network.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd blackbox-network
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Running the Code**
- **AI Black Box:** Run the `ai_blackbox.py` script to interact with a personalized AI agent.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Use the `blockchain_integration.py` script to connect to Avalanche and perform blockchain operations.
- **Soulbound Token:** Deploy the `soulbound_token.sol` smart contract using Remix IDE.
- **Synthetic Immune System:** Simulate decentralized collaboration by running `synthetic_immunesystem.py`.
- **Complete Integration:** Run the `main_integration.py` script to see all components working together.

## **Future Directions**
The project aims to:
- Expand AIT simulations with real-time brain-computer interface integration.
- Develop a decentralized network for secure AI collaboration.
- Scale blockchain integration to handle large-scale synthetic immune system interactions.
